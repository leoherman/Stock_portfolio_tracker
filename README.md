## Description
- I always wanted a tool where I am able to track all of my stocks and dividends that they yield but modern day tools doesn't allow me to log informations, I don't like tracking data on excel either. Created this web app which allows users to enter their own data like average pricing, yield and the stock itself which then allows the users the chart a portfolio. Calculator is created because I like to crunch numbers when doing things related to stocks
